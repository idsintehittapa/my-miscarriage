          <Quote>If you do not mention it yourself, nobody talks about miscarriage.
          Now that I have told friends and family,
          many have been through the same thing; but it is not something we talk openly about?

          <AboutSubTitle>Miscarriage?</AboutSubTitle>
          <P>About 30% of all pregnancies end in a miscarriage. Early miscarriages occur
          before 12 weeks, and they are usually due to something going wrong in early
          fetal development,leading to an ejection. Although a miscarriage is very
          tragic, it is usually not something that could have been changed or prevented;
          it is the body's way of ending an undeveloped pregnancy. A late miscarriage happens after week 12 until around week 22.
          After week 22, it is no longer defined as a miscarriage.
          </P>
          <AboutSubTitle>What may happen?</AboutSubTitle>
          <P>A miscarriage often begins with more or less heavy bleeding. Pain is also common.
          Some early miscarriages are taken care of by the body, but sometimes medical treatment
          or dilatation and curettage may be necessary to end the miscarriage.
          After the miscarriage, it usually takes about a month before menstruation returns.
          The first menstruation after a miscarriage may be heavier than usual, however,
          the flow and intervals usually return to normal the next cycle.

          <AboutSubTitle>Breaking the taboo and sharing experiences!</AboutSubTitle>
          <P>By talking about our miscarriages, we can break the taboo, share experiences
          to support and help someone going through it. There is scarce information covering
          what one could experience before, during, and after a miscarriage. Could it hurt?
          For how long could I bleed? Could the period change afterward? Etc.
          </P>
