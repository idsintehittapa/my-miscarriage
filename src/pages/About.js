          Now that I have told friends and family,

        <p>By talking about our miscarriages, we can break the taboo, share experiences 
          to support and help someone going through it. There is scarce information covering 
          what one could experience before, during, and after a miscarriage. Could it hurt? 
          For how long could I bleed? Could the period change afterward? Etc.
        </p>
        <p> MM is a platform where anonymous testimonies are shared. These have been collected 
          from open social media platforms or shared. Have you had a miscarriage? You are far 
          from alone ❤️ Please share your experience and break the silence culture!
        </p>

        <p> The page does not distinguish between miscarriages/missed abortions/missed miscarriage/
          and, or silent miscarriage. However, at the moment it does not include testimonies of 
          stillbirths (20th week of pregnancy).
