        <AboutP>
          This is an open source project created with the hope of helping in sharing
          experienced miscarriage testimonies. It was created (although it will never be
          finished and will be updated indefinitely) as the final project of the Technigo
          front-end developer boot camp.

        Spreading the word
        </AboutSubTitle>
        <AboutP> Even if you arenâ€™t in the position that you can contribute your time to
          this project, it still helpful if you spread the word about the project.
          It could be just a short notice in social media or a discussion you have
          with your friends. As more people become aware of the project thereâ€™s a
          better chance that we reach people who are able to contribute or share testimonies.

        <AboutP>
        When you are <a href="https://github.com/idsintehittapa/my-miscarriage/issues">reporting bugs</a>, make sure that you give a explanation
        about the outcome that you expect and what you are seeing.
        The bugs which are hardest to fix are the ones which cannot be reproduced.
