## What is this?

This is an open source project created with the hope of helping in sharing experienced miscarriage testimonies. It was created (although it will never be finished and will be updated indefinitely) as the final project of the Technigo front-end developer boot camp 2021.

Users share testimonies and whitelisted authenticated moderators approves them. All approved testimonies are visible on the page.

I am happy to answer questions or request.
